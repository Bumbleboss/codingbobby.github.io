Previously we talked about the hours we spent on coding a part of his website...

**Bumbleboss** For me it took 5 hrs just to simply stlye it a bit and organize the HTML code and get familiar with xD Like the custom styling that can be simply done by just adding the ID `#brown-bg` and it does the whole work.

**Bob** Why ID? Use a class. So you can use it more than once.

**Bumbleboss** Cuz it already had a class so I couldn't. Wait wot?

**Bob** What the heck? You can use more than one class!

**Bumbleboss** WAT?!

**Bob** That's what classes are for haha!

**Bumbleboss** (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

**Bob** `class="class_1 class_2 class_9999"`

**Bumbleboss** reeeeeeeeee `<div class="some_class" id="black-bg">`

**Bob** You can use IDs multiple times as well but they're inteded to IDENTIFY a div not STYLE it. Classes are basically for styling and IDs for identifying. Classes use again, IDs use once. That's CSS and HTML basics tho!

**Bumbleboss** A silent mouth I shall be on that one. *Finds Bob telling everyone in #coding*.

#### So?
I just told the entire internet. If you already got a class, use an ID and if you also got that one, well... HTML has some serious issue I guess.
