Hey!

Awesome to see you here.

This website started a few years ago as a weekend project when I felt the need to combine my main interests in some way.
Here I would like to share my thoughts with you and talk about things that otherwise have no place in my everyday life or are simply worth writing down.
Sometimes I have ideas that may sound a little silly, but still deserve some attention.
Or I recently learned something amazing that I want more people to know about.

Regardless of whether you know me already from my old site or if you just found it, I hope you will enjoy browsing on my small web presence[^1].

Take care, *Bob*.

### Distributed Computing
I highly recommend you to learn about [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu) if you haven't already.
It gives you the opportunity to join distributed computing networks of your choice and take part in real science research by donating some of your PC's power.

Especially in the current situation, I can only encourage you to join [Rosetta@home](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/) to contribute to research on the corona virus.
Together we can provide science with computing capacities that surpass even the most powerful supercomputers.

Here, you can see in which projects I currently participate:
