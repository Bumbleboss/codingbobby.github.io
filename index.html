          Hello guys!
          <br>
          Thrilled to see you here :)
          <br><br>
          Soooo uhm.. well, lets quickly introduce myself.
          <br>
          I - Bobby - am pretty much ordinary people. Living a life and studying
          process engineering in Germany, doing internet things, having fun with
          coding, making photographs, doing a bit sports like batminton aaand
          hugely enjoying music. Preferably metalcore. Also neo-classical
          music. Yeap. So, you're getting my personality right?
          <br><br>
          Ohhh and don't forget that science part. I'm a huge fan of physics!
          Thinking of void bubbles, MBHs, tachyons and stuff like that always relieves
          me after having a difficult time.
          <br>
          Gaming? Uhh well not really.. I mean I like Overwatch and the Final Fantasy
          franchise but not really going hard on it.

          <h2>Blog</h2>
          <p>
            I'm often thinking weird, having a great idea or just found a funny
            thing on the internet or maybe even in real life.
            <br>
            Since I guess you are here because of your interest in such things,
            I recommend you to check out my blog. I hope to have more time in near
            future so I can update it more frequently.
