The very website you are most likely browsing right now.
It is written in [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/), [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which is then compiled with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) into a static website.
